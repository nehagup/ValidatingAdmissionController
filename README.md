# Validating Admission Controller
This go controller takes care of `accepting` and `dropping` the change in annotations of any Openshift application depending upon the `whitelist` that is allowed to be exposed to CERN `technical network`.

### Logic behind the Controller

```
If route has annotation `router.cern.ch/technical-network-access: true` then
  Check if route annotation `router.cern.ch/network-visibility` has value `Internet`:
    in this case route is requesting visibility on TN+Internet+Intranet;
    otherwise it is requesting TN+Intranet
  Check value of label `router.cern.ch/technical-network-allowed` on the parent namespace:
    If `Intranet`, the project is allowed to expose routes to TN+Intranet;
    if `Internet`, the project is allowed to expose routes to TN+Intranet and TN+Internet+Intranet
    if not present or other value: project is not allowed to expose routes to TN at all
  If the requested route visibility is not allowed by the label on the namespace, reject the route creation/modification (otherwise, accept the change)
```

1. TN : Technical Network
2. Openshift's conventions on standard Openshift route annotations are followed, so the following spellings in annotation/label values are equivalent: Internet, internet, INTERNET.
3. Similarly, True/true/TRUE are equal.

### Deployment

To get started :

1. Clone this repository and spin up a local Openshift cluster in ValidatingAdmissionController using ``` oc cluster up ``` .
2. Login as an admin with ``` oc login -u system:admin ``` and deploy the webhook named `my-webhook` using ``` oc create -f webhook.yaml  ```.
3. Create a new Project, say `test` and login using the authentication token.
4. Create the deployment named `validating-service` using ``` oc create -f deployment.yaml ```.
5. Create the service named `validating-service` using ``` oc create -f serviceOC.yaml ```.
6. Create the ClusterRoleBinding role by ``` oc create -f role.json ``` and service account by ``` oc create -f serviceAccount.yaml ```.


Note : If the AdmissionController is not working, there might be a case that itâ€™s not enabled in the open-shift cluster configuration, so you can enable it by adding :

``` 
admissionConfig:
  pluginConfig:
        ValidatingAdmissionWebhook:
            configuration: {kind: DefaultAdmissionConfig, apiVersion: v1, disable: false}
```
Restart the service and check again.
